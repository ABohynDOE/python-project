# README.rst

The `README` file introduces the project.
It contains all informations required to understand the project, the code and its usage.
The usual sections are "Installation", "Usage", "License" and "Contributing".
It is usually written using markdown (`.md` files), here is a [reference](https://commonmark.org/help/) page.

A good tyemplate for a basic `README` file can be found [here](https://www.makeareadme.com/#template-1).

By default, `poetry` creates a reStructuredText file (`.rst`) that is empty, but that can be changed with a single command line (from the project directory)

```bash
rm README.rst && touch README.md
```
