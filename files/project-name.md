# project-name/ folder

This folder contains all the python code of the project.
By default, `poetry` populates it with a `__init__.py` file that only contains the version of the package.

```python
__version__ = "0.1.0
```

This is the folder in which you add your python code as your project grows.
A good practice is to create a `main.py` file to start.

```bash
touch project-name/main.py
```
